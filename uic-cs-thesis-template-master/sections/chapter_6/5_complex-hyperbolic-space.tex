\subsection{Complex hyperbolic space}

We are interested in how many of the questions in this thesis can be answered in the complex hyperbolic setting. For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item Do complex hyperbolic ends admit foliations by constant curvature (hyper)surfaces?
\item To this end, do any of the same tools transfer to the complex setting? 
\end{itemize}
For the work here, Epstein surfaces have been quite integral. So we ask:
\begin{itemize}
\item Is there an Epstein-like construction for complex hyperbolic space, i.e., an analogous way of taking geometric data on the ideal boundary $\partial^\infty \H_{\C}^n$ and constructing a (hyper)surface in $\H_{\C}^n$ such that this construction is equivariant with respect to the isometry group? 
\item For $n=2$, in what way does the fact that the boundary at infinity $\partial^\infty \H_{\C}^2$ is the 1-point compactification of the Heisenberg group affect this construction?
\end{itemize}
Similarly to the previous section, we hope to fine an $\mathrm{Isom}(\H_{\C}^2)$ frame-field description of these complex Epstein surfaces and use this to answer these questions.
