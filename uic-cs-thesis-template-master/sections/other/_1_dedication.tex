\dedication

A brief dedication to someone you care about.  For example, ``Dedicated to
my cats, Neo and Trinity, who are purrfect in every way.''.

An example of ``Dedication'' can be found on page 15 of the thesis
manual\footnote{\url{http://grad.uic.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/ThesisManual_rev_06Oct2016.pdf}}.
