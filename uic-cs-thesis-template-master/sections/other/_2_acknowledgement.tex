\acknowledgment

I would like to start by thanking my advisor David Dumas.
I thank him for suggesting this project, for indulging my preferred mathematical viewpoints, for his many comments and suggestions on drafts of my mathematical papers, and for his guidance.

I gratefully acknowledge the support of the National Science Foundation. Specifically, my research was partially funded by DMS-1246844, RTG: Algebraic and Arithmetic Geometry, at the University of Illinois at Chicago and DMS-1709877, Character Varieties and Locally Homogeneous Geometric Structures. 
I also acknowledge support from U.S. National Science Foundation grants DMS 1107452, 1107263, 1107367``RNMS: Geometric Structures and Representation Varieties" (the GEAR Network).
The GEAR network funded my trip to the University of Luxembourg where I met with Jean-Marc Schlenker. 
I thank him for helpful conversations and research suggestions.
I also thank his graduate students, including Filippo Mazzoli, for their hospitality.  

I would also like to thank the mathematics graduate students for making the University of Illinois at Chicago an enjoyable place to learn. 
I am grateful for GGTDS, grateful to Sam Dodds for our many rambling mathematical musings, and thankful to Hunter Chase for commiserating with me. 
Special thanks go to Charles Alley, J\=anis Lazovskis, and Nathan Lopez for their friendship and support, for our weekly research seminar, and for their inspiration.
In particular, I thank Charles for keeping me grounded in reality, I thank Nathan for his companionship, and I thank J\=anis for putting up with me as a roommate for five years. 
Thanks also go to the administrative staff of the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science for keeping everything running. This includes but is not limited to Maureen Madden, Lisa Jones, and Eloy Reyes.

I thank Hanni Nichols for inspiring me to pursue mathematics, for prodding me towards graduate school, for reassuring me, for believing in me, and for her friendship.
I also thank my family, Keith Quinn, Sandra Quinn, Taylor Quinn and Rom\'an Rampinini, who have been nothing but supportive. 
And finally, thank you to Irving Daniel Sandoval Gonzalez, who has been so inspiring, motivating, supportive, and understanding, and who helped me make it to the end.
